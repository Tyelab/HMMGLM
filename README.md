# Introduction
This repository contains the code for the Hidden Markov Model Generalized Linear Model (HMM GLM) developed in the Tye Lab for the modeling of complex behavior profiles in mice using neural activity. The code is completely written in MATLAB, and is optimized to be utilize multiple cores on a CPU. It has not yet been optimized to run on a GPU.

# Tips for usage
The primary functions used for training and testing are "train" and "predict_likelihood_onestep". There are multiple other functions for likelihood comptutation, training and predictions. However, these are all currently experimental.

- The document will be updated further post publication.
